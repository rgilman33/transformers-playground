Vanilla Transformer XL [(Dai 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860) with options for gated block as in DeepMind's GTrXL [(Parisotto 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06764). Objective is next-state prediction at multiple horizons. Ability to generate new data tested below.

Built by scratch module-by-module to gain intuition for each component. Useful references at [ML Explained](https://mlexplained.com/2019/07/04/building-the-transformer-xl-from-scratch/).
